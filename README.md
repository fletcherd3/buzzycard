## About BuzzyCard
BuzzyCard is "SmartCard" business card alternative created as a project to show my skills and interests in building a full-stack web application.  
The application is a MERN stack (thats MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) that uses a cards NFC (or QR code) to open a customised profile page for the user.

## How to use your BuzzyCard
It's easy as! Just tap the card on a supported phone, there's no extra app needed! If your phone isn't supported then you can easily scan the QR code on the card.
